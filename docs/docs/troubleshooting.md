## Troubleshooting

- After installation / upgrade. Please close your consoles and open new ones.
    - Same with error `Unauthorized. (Different gsudo.exe?)`. 

- Be sure you have [configured your shell](install#configure-your-shell)

- Use `gsudo --debug {command}` to see internal debug info.

- PowerShell installed as a `dotnet global tool` is [not supported](usage/powershell#known-issues).

- Search [gsudo GitHub issues](https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo/issues?q=) or create a new one.

- Chat on gitter: https://gitter.im/gsudo/
