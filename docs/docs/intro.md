**gsudo** is a `sudo` equivalent for Windows, with a similar user-experience as the original *nix sudo.
It allows to run commands with elevated permissions, or to elevate the current shell, in the current console window or a new one.

Just prepend `gsudo` (or the `sudo` alias) to your command and it will run elevated. One UAC popup will appear each time. You can see less popups if you enable [gsudo cache](credentials-cache).

It is designed so it is easy to install, easy to use, and feels familiar with other tools you already use.
